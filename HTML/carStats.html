        <p>Every day, Australians act in ways that increase the likelihood of an accident on the road. Crossing against a red light, veering slightly above the speed limit, or ‘pushing on’ to get home quicker when we are tired, as examples of these behaviours that significantly increase the risk on the road. However, some people don’t understand the risk behind these actions on the road, and the fatal consequences they hold.(NRSS, 2021)</p>
        <h1 class="carStatsHeadings">The Statistics</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                64% of Australians with full driver's licenses are involved in at least one car accident.
            </li><li>
                Speeding has been revealed as the leading cause of car accidents. This is a part of the leading causes of car accidents; Speeding, Distracted Driving, Fatigued Driving, and Drink Driving. 
            </li><li>
                In 2021, a total of 1,123 road crash deaths occurred which is 2.6% higher than in 2020. Fatalities have decreased from approximately 1,300 per year to 1,100 per year over the last decade, which, although inconsistent, was a total reduction amounted to 13.6%. (Budget Direct, 2021)
            </li><li>
                The reduction in fatality rates per population were greater than in annual counts of deaths. The rate of annual fatalities per 100,000 population declined by a total of 23.7 per cent over the decade.
            </li><li>
                In contrast to the decline in road deaths, hospitalised injuries (HI) have increased. Between 2012 and 2018 (the latest available) the total increase amounted to 16.2 per cent. A quarter of people who were hospitalised had High Threat To Life (HTTL) injuries. (Australian Government, 2022)

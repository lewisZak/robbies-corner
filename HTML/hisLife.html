        <p>
            He is an old scholar. He is a part of the stolen generation. He is a victim of one of South Australia’s leading causes of death. But more than all of this, he was a man who helped his community, who overcame adversity and who supported his community. 
        <br><br>
            Yet, he isn’t remembered as the man who impacted the college, the staff, or the students. Someone who would have numerous staff and students attending his funeral. (Simpson, 2023) He went from a man who left a lasting impression on everyone he came across, to a ‘memorial’ tucked away in the corner of the school. Students are unaware of him. Staff are unaware. Robert represents everything good in society.

            He overcame challenges given to him, and he embraced diversity. He is a role model to all in the community who want to express themselves and achieve their goals. He is also a role model to those who experience diversity in aspects of race, colour and identity.

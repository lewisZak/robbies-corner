        <p>
            Robbie’s importance to Rostrevor College can not be seen now, but rather in past events. The importance of the school to Robbie was so great, that at his funeral, hs family didn’t follow behind the hearse, but instead the group of Rostrevor students and teachers that were in attendance. The importance of the school to Robbie’s community in Point Pierce was so great that the Rossi boys went behind the Hearse. Robbie was so important to the Rostrevor College boys that they had to take a minibus in order to carry all of the students and teachers who wanted to attend his funeral. Robbie was so important to Rostrevor College that the students who attended his funeral were willing to take an over 2 hour travel time to attend.        </p>

            Robert Harradine was not just an Aboriginal Boarding Student, he was a man who was loved by all he met, leaving a lasting impression on teacher’s such as Simon Kelly within only a one year time period. Enough of a lasting impression that he would remember everything about him all these years later. Robert Harradine was loved by the school so much that after his funeral, the Boarding House director of the time gathered everyone in the boarding house around in a circle, including Robbie’s parents. They then all had converstaions about remembering Robbie, one man remembered by so many. He should be remembered as a figure of love, a kid with a good heart who had an unfortunate death. His corner is not only symbolic of an extraordinary man, but it is symbolic of the “great affection and respect that the community at Point Pierce had for Rostrevor College”. That is why Robert Harradine is an important man, that is why Robbie’s Corner must be remembered.

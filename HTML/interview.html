        <h1>Interview with Head of Humanities (Shannon Simpson)</h1>
        <h3>Q1: Who are you and what is your role within the school?</h3>
        <p>
            Mr Simpson, Head of Humanities Faculty, began teaching at Rostrevor in 2009.  
        </p>
        <h3>Q2: Are you aware of Robbie’s corner? If so, what is your connection with the location?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, I’ve become aware of Robbie’s Corner in recent years, given it is on a path I and others walk past the Boarding House, and along the College’s Kaurna Trail. Robbie was a former Rostrevor student, who sadly passed away during 2000. Mr Simon Kelly (former Rostrevor College Head of Studies of Society and Environment, 1992-2002), plus other staff and students, attended Robbie’s funeral at Point Pearce. Later, the memorial was created outside the Boarding House, with a tree planted in memory of Robbie, and an accompanying plaque. 
        </p>
        <h3>Q3: Has the lack of the school’s acknowledgement of Robbie’s Corner hindered its impact on the school?</h3>
        <p>
            Possibly; the school has other memorials of this type, and I believe it’s important for the College community to be aware of the stories of past staff and students that these memorials tell. 
        </p>
        <h3>Q4: What could we as the Rostrevor community give Robbie's Corner More Significance?</h3>
        <p>
            Robbie’s Corner, and other similar sites around the College, could be added to the walk/tour that year 7s engage with during their Enculturation Day. And/or, Robbie’s Corner should become more clearly sign-posted or labelled on a map of the College’s Kaurna Trail.
        </p>
        <h3>Q5: To what extent should the school be recognising Robbie’s Corner?</h3>
        <p>
            As above – the memorial site should be maintained by staff and/or students, so, kept neat and tidy, and the stories then of Robbie and others can be better captured and shared by the community.

        <h1>Interview with a Current Boarding Student (Kade Maddigan)</h1>
        <h3>Q1: Who are you and what is your connection to the school?</h3>
        <p>
            I am Kade Maddigan, and I am a boarder in year 12. I commenced my journey as a year 9 student in 2020 enjoying the change in environment from a country town. My connection to the school is just being a good human and offering my services to make the school and wider community a better place. I like to spread as much positivity as possible and enjoy the connections built in a boarding environment.  
        </p>
        <h3>Q2: Are you aware of Robbie’s corner? If so, what is your connection with the location?</h3>
        <p>
            I was not aware of Robbie’s corner prior to the commencement of this subject and I think that it is under recognized as a community. 
        </p>
        <h3>Q3: Has the lack of the school’s acknowledgement of Robbie’s Corner hindered its impact on the school?</h3>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned I did not know that Robbie’s Corner was a plaque in the school which is a bit disappointing. And yes I do think that Robbie’s impact on the school has not been acknowledged enough as it should have been. 
        </p>
        <h3>Q4: What could we as the Rostrevor community give Robbie's Corner More Significance?</h3>
        <p>
            I think that clearing the area around it would make a big impact as it is quite hard to see and it isn’t really a place where people can go to connect to their spirituality or if they are having a hard time. 
        </p>
        <h3>Q5: To what extent should the school be recognising Robbie’s Corner?</h3>
        <p>
            They should be recognizing it a lot more as he was an important figure in the Rostrevor community and his life is not made aware of enough as it should have.

        <p>
            Simon Kelly, A former teacher (1982-2009), Key Indigenous Educator (1999-2007). Head of Faculty: Studies of Society & Environment (1992-2002)

            Answered in the general notes from the interview.
        </p>
        <h3>Q3: Has the lack of the school’s acknowledgement of Robbie’s Corner hindered its impact on the school?</h3>
        <p>
            You need to treat robbie’s corner with discretion and sensitivity. Acknowledge that it is in memory of a student that was killed shortly after he left the school. The tree was planted after his death, near the rock that he would sit on. Know he wa a loved student of Rostrevor.
        </p>
        <h3>Q4: What could we as the Rostrevor community give Robbie's Corner More Significance?</h3>
        <p>
            Say that “Robbie’s corner is symbolic of the great affection and respect that the community at Point Pierce had for Rostrevor College who had Robbie as a student for 3 and a half years.”
        </p>
        <h3>Q5: To what extent should the school be recognising Robbie’s Corner?</h3>
        <p>
            As said previously, it was a point of reflection for Robbie in a busy school, and signifies the respect of the community towards Rostrevor, the red and black blazers were so welcome at his funeral and placed before the family.

            The Stolen Generation is a term that refers to the period of Australian history when the government removed Aboriginal children from their families and placed them into homes to assimilate Aboriginal children. This period began in the mid-1800s and continued to the late 1970s. (Healing Foundation, n.d.)
            <br><br>
            Currently, there are more than 27,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are aged over 50 that are survivors of the Stolen Generation. (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2021)
            <br><br>
            The removal of these children both disrupted and broke the spiritual, cultural, and family ties between the children and their Indigenous community. It in terms has created an intergenerational trauma within communities of Aboriginal peoples and created a divide in their equality, health, and lives of them. 
            <br><br>
            These children were forcefully removed by governments, churches, and the welfare systems working in Australia. They were placed into homes, fostered or adopted by white families. This was done to assimilate the children into Australian society. Although the intentions were good, the implementation was a failure, with systematic abuse following. Children are abused in homes, affecting their physical and mental health of the children. 
            <br><br>
            If the children of the Stolen Generation donâ€™t have the opportunity to heal, they are most likely to fall into a state of distress and neglect, which leads to disadvantages for themselves and their children. This, in context, is intergenerational trauma and is a term associated with the Stolen generation. These generations which have followed the Stolen Generation may experience detachment from society, disassociation with their culture, stress, and may deal with self-harm and may be affected in a variety of other ways. 
            <br><br>
            Combining intergenerational trauma with the affecting factors in society today, Aboriginal communities may feel neglected, and opt to be placed in institutionalisation or may commit a crime that results in institutionalisation.

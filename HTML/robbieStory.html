            Robert Harradine was always a little bit of a cheeky student, and one night he decided he was going to go and grab some chips and a drink from the nearby deli. At half past 4, he started leaving from the Boarding House when students needed to be back in the house by 5. At the same time, Simon Kelly was driving out of the school at the end of a work day with his son, Matthew, in the car. Matthew and Robbie had a fairly good relationship with each other and as they drove out Matthew noticed Robbie and told mentioned to his dad, ‘There’s Robbie’. This caused Simon to ask him where he was going, he replied and said he was headng down to the shops to grab a snack and a drink. Simon knowing the time it would take, told him that he would be late getting back if he kept going, but Robbie was insistent on going, Matthew then mentioned the idea of them taking him to the shops. So, Simon took Robbie in the car and started heading to the nearby deli, but Robbie realised that, now he was in a car, he could instead head to Coles, where it’s much cheaper. So, in this short 30 minute time span he drove all the way from Rostrevor to Firle and back all for this one student. This shows how important Robbie was to Simon, and how impactful he must’ve been on everyone he met. (Kelly, 2023)

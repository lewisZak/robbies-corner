            After conducting research, and interviews into developing our knowledge of Robert Harradine and his corner, it is time to make a change. Robert Harradine is widely unknown to students of Rostrevor College, even the director of Aboriginal education, Mr Murray (2023), is not aware of him, and his memorial is tucked away into a corner of the school many may not venture to or be able to recognise as a memorial. The corner lacks the recognition deserving of a man who not only made an impact on the school but the entire community. 
        <br><br>
            If you search on the Rostrevor College website for the term ‘Kaurna Trail’ there is no information displayed and no search results are returned. If you search the term ‘Robbie’s Corner’ there is no information displayed and no search results are returned. Why? The Kaurna Trail is a part of the college and its legacy, yet it is neglected and not recognised. 
        <br><br>
            The memorial corner itself requires maintenance, it requires care from all students and staff alike. As Head of Faculty – Humanities, Mr Simpson has stated “the memorial site should be maintained by staff and/or students, so, kept neat and tidy, and the stories then of Robbie and others can be better captured and shared by the community.” (Simpson, 2023)
        <br><br>
            The first step to this is encouraging houses to initiate weekly rosters to maintain the surrounding area, with each student and staff of the college contributing in some way. 
            Mr Simpson has also stated that; “Robbie’s Corner should become more clearly sign-posted or labelled on a map of the College’s Kaurna Trail.” (Simpson, 2023)
        <br><br>
            The second step is to encourage leaders of the college to develop better recognition for the memorial itself, implementing signposts, and/or indigenous heritage signs next to the memorial to display the significance of the site. We call the leadership of the college to develop a sign, linking to  
            the website that the group has created and contributed to is the first major action that needs to be taken towards creating recognition. The website shows the social action, the research, the ideas and the significance of Robert Harradine and is evidence of why the memorial corner needs to be recognised heavier.

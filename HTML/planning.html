            Our group spent a long time planning out everything with the purpose to bring justice to Robbie’s Corner and turn the Kaurna Trail into a special place for everyone to access. This planning began with a mind map (as seen above) that started the thought processes of what could be done to make Robbie’s Corner more special and known to the public. The website was scaffolded which involved several days of working toward every subpage that was needed. The information needed was placed onto a shared Microsoft Word document where each individual planned, researched, and wrote their assigned sections.
        <br><br>
            Eventually, the planning all came into a culmination of one large document filled with information about Robbie’s Corner and everything surrounding it, as well as ideas for what could be done to improve it. This includes brainstorming and subsequently the writing of the surveys provided to teachers and students alike. The creation of this website was then begun, and as it continued so did the planning with new section ideas, amongst many other ideas.
